## Our Story

### The Concept
while working in hospitality tech, we needed to showcase the dramatic impact of well-designed lighting scenes in hotel rooms. the challengen was how could we show this online?

### The Insight
we realized that many carefully designed spaces look incredible in person, but photos fail to capture the experience. this disconnect sends potential customers to third-party review sites, taking them away from your carefully crafted brand experience.

### The Solution
since 2020, we've been developing 360° technology and shooting hotels across Europe. now we're making our expertise available to businesses beyond hospitality. our mission is to help distinctive independent spaces showcase their unique atmosphere and connect with customers before they even visit. 

## Why This Matters?
great spaces get overlooked because flat photos don't tell the full story. we're giving your audience the confidence to book.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a 360° virtual tour?
a 360° virtual tour allows potential guests to explore your spaces from every angle, just as if they were physically there. unlike traditional photos, our tours let users look up, down, and all around, giving them a genuine sense of your space's dimensions, lighting, and atmosphere. each tour works seamlessly on mobile, desktop, and even VR headsets.

### How does this increase bookings?
studies show that immersive content reduces booking hesitation by creating confidence in purchasing decisions. when potential guests can truly experience your space before booking, they're 67%* more likely to book directly rather than continuing to research on third-party websites. this keeps them in your booking funnel and decreases abandonment rates.

additionally, 360° tours address the "expectation gap" that often leads to negative reviews when a customer's experience doesn't match what they imagined from traditional photos.

### How disruptive is the process?
we've optimized our capture process to minimize disruption to your operations. typically, photographing a standard space takes about 30-45 minutes. we work around your schedule and can often complete an entire property in just one day, depending on the package selected.

we recommend capturing spaces when they're at their best — freshly cleaned and during optimal natural lighting conditions.

### How do we integrate this with our existing website?
integration is seamless regardless of your website platform. we provide:
- simple embed codes that work with any modern cms (wordpress, wix, squarespace, etc.)
- direct links for email marketing campaigns
- qr codes for print materials and in-room information
- technical support throughout the implementation process
- hosting services for materials if needed

our tours are also optimized for social media sharing, allowing you to use the same assets across multiple channels (google, facebook, instagram, tiktok, etc.).
